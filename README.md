The game is initiated by opening the index.html in your browser.</br>
The goal of the game is to get to the other side of the screen while avoiding bugs.</br>
You navigate the player with arrow keys.</br>
You can change the speed of the enemy by changing the enemySpeed variable in the app.js file.</br>
You can also change the distance the player moves with each keystroke by changing the playerRange.</br>
variable also in the app.js file.</br>
