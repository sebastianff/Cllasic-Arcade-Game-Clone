The game is initiated by opening the index.html in your browser.
The goal of the game is to get to the other side of the screen
while avoiding bugs.
You navigate the player with arrow keys.
You can change the speed of the enemy by changing the enemySpeed variable in the app.js file.
You can also change the distance the player moves with each keystroke by changing the playerRange
variable also in the app.js file.

Have Fun!
